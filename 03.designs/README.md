# Experimental Designs and Characterization

The folders in this section contain the scripts and data to mimic the grafting design experiments presented in the paper.

Each folder contains all the data related to that particular case. Inside it, there are three main folders:

* **design:** Contain all the data and script to make the design again (as far as Rosetta would allow it).

* **benchmark:** Contains a small benchmark testing the outcomes for different conditions of the design in the presence of the target antibody.

* **selection:** Contains the final predicted structures and obtained experimental data for all the designs that were selected and tested in experimentally.
