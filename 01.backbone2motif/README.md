# Capturing conformational and sequence changes in small protein domains

This part of the repository refers to the first computational benchmark performed for **FunFolDes** as described in the paper.

For each target, a README detailing the individual analysis can be found.

Each target contains a series of folders:

* **baseline:** Contains the basic data of the template as analysed with Rosetta.
* **cscs:** SLURM scripts prepared to submit the different jobs to the [Swiss National Supercomputer Center (CSCS)](https://www.cscs.ch/).
* **fragments:** Scripts to create sequence-based (*picker*) and structure-based (*wauto*) fragments to guid the folding process.
* **hmm:** HMM and results form the [hmmsearch](http://hmmer.org/) execution.
* **output:** Minimized data extracted from the silent files generated by the different round. First part of the file refers to the protocol used, either abinitio (*abinitio*) or FunFolDes (*nubinitio*). Second part refers to the fragment type: sequence-based (*picker*) or structure-based (*wauto*).
* **scripts:** Contains the necessary scripts to execute an RosettaScript-based abinitio (*run.abinitio.xml*) or FunFolDes (*run.nubinitio.xml*).
* **structures:** Holds the structures of the template and the target.
