**FunFolDes** is part of the [Rosetta Suite](https://www.rosettacommons.org/software) and can be freely obtained with an academic license.

The three main segments of this repository are:

* **01.backbone2motif:** Contains all the data and scripts referring to the paper's section **Capturing conformational and sequence changes in small protein domains**.

* **02.backbone2binder:** Contains all the data and scripts referring to the paper's section **Target-biased folding and design of protein binders**.

* **03.designs:** Contains all the data, scripts and experimental data referring to the designed proteins provided as proof of concept in the article: an RSVF site II carrier (based on *1kx8*) and a RSVF site IV carrier (based in *TOP7*).

Lastly, the folder named **resources** contains the instructions to build the necessary databases to run the experiments and pieces of **RosettaScripts** commonly shared by all scripts in the repository executing the FunFolDes protocol.
